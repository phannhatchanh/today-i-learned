# How to create page like this?

This page is built using [**Nextra**](https://nextra.vercel.app) ([repo here](https://github.com/shuding/nextra)), a Next.js and MDX powered, no-code site generator by [@shuding](https://github.com/shuding) and [@pacocoursey](https://github.com/pacocoursey) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

It comes with two themes: [docs](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/core/packages/nextra-theme-docs)(`nextra-theme-docs`) and [blog](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/core/packages/nextra-theme-blog)(`nextra-theme-blog`). This site you are seeing is using `nextra-theme-docs`.

Follow [**these instructions**](https://nextra.site) to get started making your own.

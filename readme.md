I made this project to have a place where I can put my personal documentations / notes / any references which works for me. Most of it may be opinionated and not work for everyone, but feel free to make use of the content as your references.

This project is bootstrapped using [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra), a Next.js and MDX powered, no-code site generator by [@shuding](https://github.com/shuding) and [@pacocoursey](https://github.com/pacocoursey) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

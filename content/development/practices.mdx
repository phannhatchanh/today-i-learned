# Practices

Some engineering practices.

## Conventional Commits

A convention on top of commit messages, conforms with SemVer.

### Why use conventional commits?

- communicate and document changes better (easier to read and track).
- a more structured commit history, helping others to contribute easier.
- directs us to commit by scope (a commit for a specific problem)
- helps to generate automatic changelog when using `standard-version`.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

# example
feat(pages): add home page
```

| type   |                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `feat` | adds a new feature which brings changes |
| `fix`  | bug fix                                 |

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) to help you compose conventional commit messages.

## Conventional Comments

Code reviews can be better if we understand that the code we are reviewing are written by human and our review are also gonna be read by human. Sometimes we don't realize if our comments are unhelpful. This can be improved by following [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/), a convention which are inspired by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Google Engineering Practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/57c895ad4b09c8941288c04e44a08797b76b4d4d/review/reviewer/standard.md#mentoring).

example of unhelpful comments:

> It's not worded correctly

by giving a label prefix:

> **suggestion**: It's not worded correctly
>
> how about `other_word` instead?

sounds better, right? Reducing undercommunication and misunderstandings.

```
<label> [decorations]: <subject>

[discussion]
```
